# My-Own-Cipher

Hi, it's my coding alghoritm. I created it about three years ago, today I have typed it again in more.. "proffessional" way :). Let me tell You idea.

This Widows console application is based on random hash and Caesar's code. It draws key then translates characters into two-digits numbers, adds key value to each and draws a hash. Length of hash is key value. Final structure of code is

[key][hash][encrypted text][hash]
